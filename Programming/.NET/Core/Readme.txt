ASP.NET Core, MVC 6, EF Core and Angular course on Pluralsight

ASP.NET Core is open sourced built on GitHub.
MVC and WebApi are combined. WebForms is gone.
Everything is a dependency. Nuget packages. Better performance.
ASP.NET Core is compatible with .NET Core and .NET 4.6.
We can continue to manage our ASP.NET website Core on IIS. 
Self hosted also supported. 

Core idea is a composition of our application.

Embrace open web development
- npm for tooling support
- bower for client-side library support
- grunt and gulp for build automation
- nuget for .net packages
