Pluralsight course:

*** use express
folder for views, src/views
folder for routes, src/routes

export modules
pass data to external module

use .all() to put common logic like db access, error handling
.all() is a middleware 

use body-parser package to map body or url data into json objects

*** use mssql
installed typing npm install --save mssql

if we open the connection in the main js file and pull mssql packege from another file, 
we already have the connection - nodejs context persists the state globally
mssql sends the result in json format

*** use mongodb
working with collections

we pull MongoClient, ObjectID from mongodb package
methods find, findOne...
we can use Mongoose ORM 

*** authentication 
we can use passport framework
passport will pars the cookies for authentication 
passport uses express session, we jave pull it as first module
we use passport-local to do local auth

using passport we can do fb, google, twitter and other authentication.

*** use http and xml2js
http package to do http request from nodejs code
xml2js to convert from xml to json
