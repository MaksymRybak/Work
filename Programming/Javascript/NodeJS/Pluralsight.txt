Pluralsight course:

use express
folder for views, src/views
folder for routes, src/routes

export modules
pass data to external module

use .all() to put common logic like db access, error handling
.all() is a middleware 

use mssql
installed typing npm install --save mssql

if we open the connection in the main js file and pull mssql packege from another file, 
we already have the connection - nodejs context persists the state globally
mssql sends the result in json format
